Team Sisyphus/Saguarophus Game Installation and Running Instructions

Navigate to the Team GitHub: https://github.com/deschafer/Sisyphus

Inside the folder labeled "doc", there is an executable labeled "Sisyphus". Download the executable (you can clone the repository or just download the executable file).

Click on the executable to run the game. The main menu will open first. We suggest playing the game in "Normal Play Mode". In Dr. BC mode, you cannot die BUT because you cannot
die you also cannot lose the game. You will have to force quit out of Dr. BC mode using cntrl-alt-delete. 

When you die in Normal Play Mode, you are presented with the option of playing again or quitting. 

Press "Quit" from either menu to quit the application.
